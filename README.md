![SADAQAPP Logo](public/logo.svg)

## üìã Project Overview

SADAQAPP is a Shariah-compliant fintech platform designed to help low-income users with limited digital and financial literacy manage finances, request aid, and make donations through an inclusive, voice-first interface. The platform enables:
